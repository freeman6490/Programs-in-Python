QBR
Basic computational program. The purpose of this is just to show I am able to follow directions and use code to solve math problems. 
'''
'''
need to ask for:
ompletions
attempts
yards
touchdowns
interceptions

Then:
(completions/attempts -.3) X 5
(yards/attempts -3) X .25
(touchdowns/attempts) X 20
2.375 - (interceptions/attempts) X 25

Then:
add all up, divide all by 6, and multiply all by 100
'''

completions = float(input("Enter number of completions: "))
attempts = float(input("Enter number of attempts: "))
yards = float(input("Enter number of yards: "))
touchdowns = float(input("Enter number of touchdowns: "))
interceptions = float(input("Enter number of interceptions: "))

a = ((completions/attempts)-.3) * 5
b = ((yards/attempts)-3) * .25
c = (touchdowns/attempts) * 20
d = 2.375 - ((interceptions/attempts)*25)

QBR = ((a + b + c + d)/6) * 100

print("The QBR is %.2f" % QBR)
